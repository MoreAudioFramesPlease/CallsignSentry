🛡️ The "Why": Cognitive Gap in Flight

In modern aviation, we have moved the needle on safety through advanced avionics (for those who can afford them), but the Communication Layer for many General Aviation flights remains stuck in 1945. Radio transmissions are "ephemeral"—they exist for a few seconds and then vanish.

If a pilot is task-saturated (fighting turbulence, navigating a complex arrival, or managing a mechanical issue), comms can take a backseat. In the best-case scenario, this leads to a "Say Again" request that clutters the frequency. In the worst-case scenario, it leads to a Runway Incursion or a Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).

The "Risk-Stacking" Problem: As highlighted in Paul A. Craig's The Killing Zone (required reading for a new pilot), accidents (+ incidents and deviations) are rarely the result of a single catastrophic failure. They are a "stack" of small risks. You may know this as the "swiss cheese" model. 

CallsignSentry is designed to kick a small piece out of that stack. By turning raw RF on a tuned or non-tuned frequency into actionable data, we give the pilot a way to look back in time and recover from a moment of distraction. Maybe that only saves them a bit of embarassment, but it might save more. 

Our Core Philosophy: "Guardian, not Pilot"
We are not building an "Auto-Pilot" for communication. The system doesn't talk, it just listens, and makes a best effort to provide information you need right now in a non-distracting way. 

High-Stakes Accuracy: We need to hear "Cessna 123AB" through the static when it matters most. And every false positive is a reason for a pilot to lose trust and give up on this as a cockpit resource.

The Call to Action: If you are an engineer who wants to help build this, jump right in. We want to build a human factors safety net. Every improvement can contribute towards preventing "Loss of Situational Awareness" incidents.
