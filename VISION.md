🛡️ The "Why": Solving the Cognitive Gap in Flight
The Invisible Crisis: Radio Ephemerality
In modern aviation, we have moved the needle on safety through advanced avionics (for those who can afford them), but the Communication Layer for many General Aviation flights remains stuck in 1945. Radio transmissions are "ephemeral"—they exist for a few seconds and then vanish.

If a pilot is task-saturated (fighting turbulence, navigating a complex arrival, or managing a mechanical issue), their "input buffer" overflows. When that happens, critical instructions are missed. In the best-case scenario, this leads to a "Say Again" request that clutters the frequency. In the worst-case scenario, it leads to a Runway Incursion or a Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT).

The "Risk-Stacking" Problem
As highlighted in Paul A. Craig's The Killing Zone: How & Why Pilots Die (which is required reading for any new pilot), accidents are rarely the result of a single catastrophic failure. They are a "stack" of small risks:

Fatigue +

Poor Weather +

Missing a single ATC frequency change.

CallsignSentry is designed to kick the bottom out of that stack. By turning raw RF on a non-tuned frequency into actionable data, we give the pilot a way to look back in time and recover from a moment of distraction before it becomes a link in an accident chain.

Our Core Philosophy: "Guardian, not Pilot"
We are not building an "Auto-Pilot" for communication. We are building a Digital Wingman.

Passive Observation: The system doesn't talk; it listens.

Low-Cognitive Load: The interface must be "glanceable." If the pilot has to menu-dive, we have failed.

High-Stakes Accuracy: We need to hear "Cessna 123AB" through the static when it matters most. And every false positive is a reason for a pilot to lose trust and give up on this as a cockpit resource.

The Call to Action
If you are an engineer who wants to work on something that matters, help us build this. We aren't just parsing text; we are building a human factors safety net. Every improvement can contribute towards preventing a "Loss of Situational Awareness" incident.

Let’s stop losing lives to "I didn't hear the call."
